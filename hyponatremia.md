# Case CC

85 yo woman w/ h/o HFpEF, AF, CKD stage G3b, PAD, inflammatory arthritis, hypothyroidism and OA. On mutliple diuretics **(s/p tolvaptan for 4 days last week)**, still hyponatremic at 120 w/o symptoms. Likely due to neurochemical changes from HFpEF and low solute intake

# Recommendations
- **Asymptomatic** patients with chronic hyponatremia should be treated with *fluid restriction* and *diuretics*.
- Patients with chronic hypoonatremia who are **hyponatremic on admission** seem to respond better than those with acute hyponatremia.

- Patients w/ **HFpEF** seem to benefit significantly benefit from *fluid restriction* over those with HFrEF.
- Also have more rapid rates of change, which is likely to be more clinically meaningful.

![bg right fit](/Users/yilunzhang/Dropbox/slides/images/hyponatremia/salt.png)

- *15mg tolvaptan daily*, consider increase to 30mg if no response after 24 hours w/ careful monitoring of serum sodiums
- Monitor for improvements at *Day 4* and *Day 30*
- Consider monitoring LFTs for hepatoxicity from tolvaptan
  - **Cannot continue after Day 30 due to toxicity**

# Presentation

## Acute Adrenal Insufficiency
_Two hours after undergoing open cholecystectomy_ for complicated cholecystitis, a 48-year-old woman develops _dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea_. She has _systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension_. Prior to hospitalization, her medications included nifedipine and _prednisolone_. Her pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg. Examination shows central obesity. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. Her _serum cortisol and serum ACTH are decreased_. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?

---
A 69-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of _fatigue and lethargy for 5 days._ She has also had _weakness and nausea for the last 3 days_. She has sarcoidosis, major depressive disorder, and hypertension. She had a stroke 5 years ago. Current medications include aspirin, nifedipine, _prednisolone_, fluoxetine, and rosuvastatin, but she has not taken any of her medications for 7 days due to international travel. Her temperature is 36.1 C, pulse is 95/min, and blood pressure is _85/65 mm Hg_. She is lethargic but oriented. Examination shows no other abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13.4 g/dL and leukocyte count is 9,600/mm3. _Both serum cortisol and ACTH levels are decreased_. This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional laboratory abnormalities?

# Risk Factors



A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after developing a severe headache and neck stiffness. The pain was of sudden onset and feels more severe than her normal headaches. Her temperature is 97.7 F , blood pressure is 155/89 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A CT scan of her head is obtained and shown in Figure A and an ECG is performed as seen in Figure B. The patient is appropriately treated and transferred to the ICU. Which of the following is most likely to develop in this patient during their stay in the ICU?

# Etiology

# Management
## First Step in Management: Is it even real?
Assess tonicity/osmolarity:


---
## Is ADH on?


---
## Is Aldosterone on?


---
## Corecting too quickly!

A _74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs._ He is a known alcoholic. He was started on IV fluids and received a head CT, which was negative. It was decided that he would be watched for one day before being discharged, after a negative work-up. Suddenly, he is _unable to move his arms and legs in addition to experiencing difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking_. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances was most likely corrected too aggressively?
